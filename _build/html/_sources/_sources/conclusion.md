# Conclusion

Within drug discovery, the Lotka-Volterra model can be applied to various aspects in the pre-clinical stage. The need to
understand the evolution of pathogens and cancerous tumors and how they interact within host and between hosts is 
crucial for drug development and drug treatment strategies. The Lotka-Volterra model has the potential to help us 
better understand the dynamics between the different organisms/viruses facilitating evolution and competing for 
resources.
