# Abstract

The Lotka-Volterra Model was developed over a century ago and has been used to model population interactions in 
ecology, banking, chemistry, and biology. A detailed introduction to the model equations and their 
mathematical properties is provided. Then a summary of several applications of the model in different drug discovery 
settings is detailed.
